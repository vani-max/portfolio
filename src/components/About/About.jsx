              I'm Vani Vashishtha from Uttar Pradesh, currently a second-year B-Tech student at Newton School of Technology, Rishihood University. An aspiring full-stack web developer passionate about creating meaningful web experiences. I have hands-on experience building multiple projects that solve real-world problems, and I'm constantly improving my technical skills by tackling complex coding challengesâ€”120+ DSA problems solved on LeetCode.
              <br /><br />
              Beyond coding, I'm an active volunteer, a member of the Literary Club, Vice President of the Robotics Club, and a lawn tennis enthusiast. I enjoy collaborating on projects, learning new technologies, and turning ideas into functional solutions. My goal is to contribute to impactful projects while continuously growing as a developer.
